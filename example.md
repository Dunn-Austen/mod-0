**About**
- A comparison template was provided (see below) as part of a challenge meant to assess HTML, CSS, and JS familiarity. The work of diagnosing and then reconstructing a website's design from scratch comprised the initial aspects of the project, though the steepest challenges required a proficiency with vanilla javascript at the level of navigating interactions between the DOM and the data model, with ensuring the persistence of data in the browser.
- The project also required the use of the *masonry layout*.
